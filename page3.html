<h1> Powerlines </h1>
<p> Power lines play a crucial part the massive infrastructre which makes up the internet. These tall structures carry overhead cables which are used to transmit electrical energy. This electrical energy can be used to power the machinery used to convert binary data, which is ultimately what makes up the internet. These large posts also often carry the direct cable which carry this data from an ip adress to a server, allowing us to access information over the internet.     </p>

<h3> Examples in Wellington </h3>
<img class="img1" src="./images/plo1.jpg" align="left">
<p> This is an example of one of many powerlines in Wellington. Rather than carrying cables through underground networks, these powerlines can carry electricity to power our machinery aswell as the cables which carry the binary data. These cables play a huge part in the internet infrastructre, allowing us to connect through the rapid transaction of binary code. </p>
