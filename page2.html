<h1> Cameras </h1>
<p> Cameras are very present in the Wellington environment, with many purposes such as security and traffic managment. These cameras are often only a peice of the puzzle to a much larger system of networks which makes this visual information both accessible and usable. IP cameras specifically recieve data and send the image data over the internet, allowing it be accessed online.   </p>
